# Purifiler
This desktop application, written with the help of Compose Multiplatform, aims to rename font files from Google Fonts to make them compatible with the Android Studio font package.

## Future of the Purifiler
Once I have acquired proficiency in Jetpack Compose, I plan to enhance this application by adding features such as drag-and-drop folder support and customizable file name editing capabilities for users, as well as improving its visual design.
